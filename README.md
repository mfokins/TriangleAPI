# TriangleAPI
Application is determining triangle type according to the user input.

The purpose of the project was to combine Java backend (REST) and Angular frontend (JS controller and html+css). 
Working principle: User is entering values into web application and sends them to the backend where logic is determining the triangle type and sending back the result, thus allowing the display of a relevant image and text requested by user input.
